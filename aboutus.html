      <h3>About us</h3>
      <p>
        We are a small, heart-driven initiative with one clear goal: to make a difference for animals, people, and the planet. 
        This project is not backed by big companies — it’s personal, transparent, and honest. 
        Right now, it’s just me working on it, but together with you, we can build a community that cares.
        By using this app, supporting, or even just being here, you are part of something that creates real-world impact. 
        We dream of a future where compassion grows stronger every day — and you are part of that story.
